### Introduction
This tutorial introduces a number of skills related to mapping data in `R`: data cleaning, table joins, and map production. `R` is not a replacement for a GIS like ArcGIS or QGIS. However, its mapping tools are useful for previewing data and creating quick maps, particularly of quantitative data. `R` is also particularly useful for its spatial statistics tools.
